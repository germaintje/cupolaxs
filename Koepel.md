The ICP chain offers several security features and benefits for the De Koepel Haarlem booking system:

1. Data privacy: Developers can choose to make data private, encrypted, and accessible only by authorized parties.
2. Data mutability: The Internet Computer supports data mutability, allowing developers to update or delete data as needed to comply with GDPR principles.
3. Access control: Developers can implement their own data protection and privacy policies, manage user consent, and use canister smart contracts to enforce data security and integrity.
4. Decentralized network: Node providers go through a rigorous vetting process before being voted in by token holders, ensuring a secure and reliable network.
5. VetKeys (under development): This feature will allow distributed decryption, enhancing data security and preventing unauthorized access.
6. AMD SEV-SNP (launching later in 2024): This technology will secure the boundary node Virtual Machine, isolating it from potential external threats and creating a digital boundary around data.

By leveraging these features, the De Koepel Haarlem booking system can ensure data integrity, protect sensitive information, and comply with GDPR regulations.
